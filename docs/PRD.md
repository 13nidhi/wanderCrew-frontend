## 1. Executive Summary  

**Problem**  
Many travel enthusiasts, especially those on a budget, find it difficult to find like-minded people to travel with. They either end up traveling alone, which can be expensive, or with people they don't know well, leading to a suboptimal experience. The process of planning a trip itinerary is also time-consuming and often requires juggling multiple tools.  

**Solution**  
WanderGroup is a mobile application that allows users to create and join group trips based on shared interests and budget. It leverages AI to generate personalized itineraries and uses Google Maps API to provide a visual and logistical plan, making group travel more accessible, affordable, and enjoyable.

Budget-conscious and enthusiastic travelers aged **20â€“35**, who are open to meeting new people and sharing travel experiences. This includes college students, young professionals, and solo adventurers.
